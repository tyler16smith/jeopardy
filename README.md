# Play Jeopardy - Full Stack Web App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## How to get started

1. Clone this repository locally: ```git clone https://github.com/tyler16smith/jeopardy.git```
2. Copy the ```.env.example``` and paste it as ```.env```. From there, copy over the DATABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, and SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY all from supabase. The DATABASE_URL is the connection string which you can find in the settings tab.
2. Go to the root folder and run ```pnpm install```
3. Click the "Run and Debug" button, then select "Full Stack" and press play. OR you can go to the root and run ```pnpm dev```. I highly recommend running the debugger for local development so you can add breakpoints anywhere in the frontend or backend.
4. Get building ðŸš€
